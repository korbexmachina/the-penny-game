# Simulation of The Penny Game

I wrote this for a class project, it's really just a bit of fun.

## Playing the game

To play the game, clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/korbexmachina/the-penny-game.git`

cd into the directory:

`cd the-penny-game`

Run the game with

`python3 penny-game.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.9.12 or higher
(It is almost definitely compatible with older versions of python 3, but I tested it on 3.9.12)
